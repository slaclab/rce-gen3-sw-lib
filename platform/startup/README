This package builds two versions of the system core, i.e., RTEMS +
newlib + RCE C++ support + the RCE dynamic linker. The prod version
doesn't have NFS mounting or the shell, the devel version does.

The major and minor version numbers for the core are specified near
the top of constituents.mk. The values are propagated using the rules
in core.mk.
