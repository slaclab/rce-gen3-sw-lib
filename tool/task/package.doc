  @mainpage Task Interface

  A TASK is defined as a pure RTEMS task along with its corresponding
  (dynamically linked) executable code.  That executable code is
  specified by its (file based image), which is loaded and linked
  before its corresponding task is started.

  Once started (through ::Task_Run), the resulting task may be treated
  as any other RTEMS task with the exception of deletion, which must
  be accomplished by calling ::Task_Stop.

  @note
   - The executable code associated with the task must have been
     *statically* linked with library libtaskstub.a which establishes
     its correct RTEMS entry point.
   - The specification of the task to be started is determined by
     the ::Task_Attributes structure. 

  The RTEMS SDK provides a wrapper to perform the static link of
  a user task with libtaskstub.a: @c rtems_task.
