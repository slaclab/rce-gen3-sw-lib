    @mainpage Hash package

    The @c %Hash package provides an interface to the well known
    [Jenkins hashing algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenkins_hash_function).
    This facility supports hashing three types of
    objects:
    -# NULL terminated strings
    -# Arbitrary length 32-bit vectors
    -# Pairs of 64 and 32 bit values.

    The resultant hash is always expressed as a unique, pseudo-random
    64-bit value.


    While the interface to @c %Hash is a pure C interface, it may
    be used by C++ classes and methods.

    The public methods and their signatures are:
    - uint64_t HashWord(const uint32_t*, uint32_t, uint32_t)
    - uint64_t HashString(const char*, uint32_t)
    - uint64_t Hash64_32(uint64_t, uint32_t)
