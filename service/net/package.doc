   @mainpage Net Package

   The @c Net Package is a C++ library intended to encapsulate
   networking information and setup.  It abstracts away all the libc
   functions and structures (such as @c setsockopt, @c getifaddrs, and
   @c struct @c ifaddrs) into these classes which have simpler
   signatures and options.  This sacrifices some flexibility, but these
   classes should work for at least 90% of networking usage.

   The classes are:
     - Interface -- Encapsulate a network interface.
     - Endpoint -- Encapsulate a single network socket.
     - Socket -- IPV4 Network Datagram socket transmit/receive semantics.
     - Multicast -- Encapsulate a multicast network socket.
     - MacAddress -- Hold and pretty-print a MAC address.
